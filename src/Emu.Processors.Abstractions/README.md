# Memory: 
Storage of data
Storage of a program
Either can be temporary or “permanent” storage

# Registers: small, fast memories
General purpose: store arbitrary data
Special purpose: used to control the processor


# Instruction decoder:
Translates current program instruction into a set of control signals

# Arithmetic logical unit:
Performs both arithmetic and logical operations on data: add, subtract, multiply, AND, OR ...

# Control Unit:

Control units (CUs)  receive signals from the CPU, which instructs the control unit to move  data from microprocessor to microprocessor.
The control unit also  directs the arithmetic and logic unit.

# System Bus:
Many of these components must exchange data with one-another
It is common to use a ‘bus’ for this exchange
